## Purpose
Designed for those who don't have a computer but have a smartphone [^1] and would like to experiment with programming, BacioneJS is the most [thumb-friendly](https://youtu.be/lx6Pf-KflcQ?si=jBlJVh4iwFUp_Nj8) IDE for coding small JavaScript games on a phone offline; the only IDE with a fully [custom keyboard](//github.com/search?q=ide+%22custom+keyboard%22&type=repositories) and the only IDE implemented in [standalone JavaScript](//github.com/search?q=standalone+javascript+ide+language%3Ahtml&type=repositories). These innovations reduce editing frustration, simplify installation, and enable rapid enhancements.

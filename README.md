> BacioneJS is an innovative, standalone JavaScript editor and IDE designed specifically for mobile use. It stands out by featuring a fully custom, thumb-friendly keyboard and running completely offline from a single HTML file, making coding accessible to anyone with an Android phone, regardless of computer access.

```

Developed with the mission to democratize coding, BacioneJS transforms any Android phone into a powerful, pocket-sized Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Unlike traditional mobile editors, BacioneJS requires no installation and operates entirely offline from a single bacionejs.html file. Its major innovation is the custom keyboard and logic, which simplifies the entry of code symbols and commands, eliminating the typical frustrations of mobile programming and making it the most thumb-friendly solution for developing small JavaScript games.

## Bacione?
Bacione means big KISS as in Keep It Satisfyingly Simple.

## Purpose
Programming small JavaScript games on a phone offline

## Mission
Create the most thumb-friendly IDE in its class

## Unique
As of March 2025, BacioneJS stands alone as the [only](//github.com/search?q=serverless+javascript+ide+language%3Ahtml&type=repositories) serverless JavaScript IDE built entirely in JavaScript and the [only](//github.com/search?q=ide+%22custom+keyboard%22&type=repositories)
IDE with a fully custom keyboard. These features simplify installation, enable rapid enhancements and reduce editing frustrating.

## Features
- **Serverless**: No backend needed
- **Pure JS**: No dependencies, vanilla JavaScript
- **Keyboard**: One-tap common keys
- **Run**: Instant code execution
- **Save**: Generates a new timestamped file
- **Export**: Removes editor
- **Editing**: Cut, copy, paste, undo, redo
- **Code Assistance**: Auto-complete, auto-indent, auto-comment
- **Rename**: Highlights matches as you type
- **Superstar**: Highlights all instances of the current word
- **Debugging**: Displays message and positions the cursor at the issue
- **Diff**: Changes since open/save
- **Themes**: Light and dark mode syntax highlighting
- **Zoom**: Adjust text size
- **Fullscreen**: Expand your workspace
- **Gestures**: Swipe and long-press-repeat support
- **Pickers**: Icon and color selectors
- **Help**: Built-in guide
- **Examples**: Games included
- **Efficiency**: Fewer clicks than competing editors
- **Design**: Optimized for phones and tablets
- **Setup**: None—just one file
- **Sharing**: Easy to send
- **Offline**: No internet required
- **Compatibility**: Runs from Android file manager in Chrome
- **Free**: GPL licensed, ad-free
- **Lightweight**: Just 7 KB
- **Self-Editable**: Modify the editor within itself

## Help
- **Swipe**: Swipe up on a key for alternate functions:  
  - Save → Diff  
  - Zoom → Fullscreen  
  - Rename → Superstar Highlight  
  - Misc → Themes  
  - Characters → Shift-like behavior  
- **Editing**: Copy button selects. Backspace cuts. Enter cancels. Repeat to extend or use arrows. See a demo on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/@bacionejs).  
- **Paste Buffer**: The Comment button and the Pickers use the Paste buffer.  
- **Closing Views**: Tap anywhere to dismiss views  

## Limitations
- **Compatibility**: Requires Chrome on phones or tablets. Exported games have no such restriction.
- **Single-File**: Android’s file manager limits Chrome to a single HTML file, excluding external assets like images or audio. Use programmatic alternatives (e.g., vector graphics, emojis, noise generators) as seen in Marslander.
- **Alternative**: For complex needs, try [Neovim with Termux and Apache](https://github.com/bacionejs/termux).

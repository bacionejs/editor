> BacioneJS is an innovative, standalone JavaScript editor and IDE designed specifically for mobile use. It stands out by featuring a fully custom, thumb-friendly keyboard and running completely offline from a single HTML file, making coding accessible to anyone with an Android phone, regardless of computer access.

> Developed with the mission to democratize coding, BacioneJS transforms any Android phone into a powerful, pocket-sized Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Unlike traditional mobile editors, BacioneJS requires no installation and operates entirely offline from a single bacionejs.html file. Its major innovation is the custom keyboard and logic, which simplifies the entry of code symbols and commands, eliminating the typical frustrations of mobile programming and making it the most thumb-friendly solution for developing small JavaScript games.

> Bacione JavaScript Editor Integrated Development Environment (BacioneJS) is a unique open-source project (GPL licensed) built entirely in vanilla JavaScript with zero dependencies. This design choice ensures maximum accessibility and portability, allowing the entire IDE to run offline from a simple HTML file. BacioneJS is targeted at aspiring programmers who lack consistent access to a traditional computer, offering a full suite of features—including instant code execution, debugging, and code assistance—all optimized for a mobile touchscreen via its custom keyboard interface.

> Developed with the mission to democratize coding, BacioneJS transforms any Android phone into a powerful, pocket-sized Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The name "Bacione" means "big kiss" in Italian, reflecting the core philosophy of Keep It Satisfyingly Simple (KISS). This simplicity drives its design: it runs entirely offline from a single HTML file, requires zero setup, and features a revolutionary custom keyboard optimized for thumbs. At just 7 kilobytes zipped, the project delivers a full-featured IDE—proving that you get a lot for little code. By simplifying the entry of complex code symbols and commands, BacioneJS eliminates the typical frustrations of mobile programming, making coding accessible and genuinely enjoyable for beginners.

> BacioneJS is not just an editor; it's a portable coding laboratory for mobile users. To ensure beginners can start immediately, the single-file IDE is pre-loaded with numerous small, runnable JavaScript games that are perfect for tinkering and learning. These basic examples include classic logic puzzles and physics simulations, such as: Chess, Snake, Pairs, Missile Defense, Monkey Maze, Mars Lander, Bike, and Ski. This integrated, hands-on environment lets developers bypass complicated setup, allowing them to instantly see how simple game mechanics work and modify the code right on their phone, completely offline.

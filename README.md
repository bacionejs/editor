## Bacione?
Bacione means big KISS as in Keep It Satisfyingly Simple.

## Purpose
Programming small JavaScript games on a phone offline

## Mission
Create the most thumb-friendly IDE in its class

## Unique
As of March 2025, BacioneJS stands alone as the [only](//github.com/search?q=serverless+javascript+ide+language%3Ahtml&type=repositories) serverless JavaScript IDE built entirely in JavaScript and the [only](//github.com/search?q=ide+%22custom+keyboard%22&type=repositories)
IDE with a fully custom keyboard. These features simplify installation, enable rapid enhancements and reduce editing frustrating.

## Help
- **Swipe**: Swipe up on a key for alternate functions:  
  - Save → Diff  
  - Zoom → Fullscreen  
  - Rename → Superstar Highlight  
  - Misc → Themes  
  - Characters → Shift-like behavior  
- **Editing**: Copy button selects. Backspace cuts. Enter cancels. Repeat to extend or use arrows. See a demo on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/@bacionejs).  
- **Paste Buffer**: The Comment button and the Pickers use the Paste buffer.  
- **Closing Views**: Tap anywhere to dismiss views  

## Limitations
- **Compatibility**: Requires Chrome on phones or tablets. Exported games have no such restriction.
- **Single-File**: Android’s file manager limits Chrome to a single HTML file, excluding external assets like images or audio. Use programmatic alternatives (e.g., vector graphics, emojis, noise generators) as seen in Marslander.
- **Alternative**: For complex needs, try [Neovim with Termux and Apache](https://github.com/bacionejs/termux).
